## About The Project
<p align="center">
    A Python program that systematically renames numerous JPG files in a folder such that they contain only numbers and start at index 0. More specifically, the program extracts only the numbers from the filenames and then adjusts these numbers so that all filenames include only its adjusted number and the first file's name is 0 ("0.JPG"). I wrote this program so that I could reference the image files more systematically in another web project, where I iterate through the images on multiple occasions.
